# Calendar App

A simple calendar mini product built as a learning project.

This project focuses on understanding how a calendar works, how small UI interactions feel, and how simple animations can improve user experience.  
The design is created with my own unique cozy style, keeping everything clean and intentional.

I chose to build something I clearly understand instead of adding unnecessary complexity. Every part of this project reflects what I am genuinely aware of and confident in.
